# LegacyLens

*Building RAG Systems for Legacy Enterprise Codebases*

---

## Before You Start: Pre-Search (60 Minutes)

Before writing any code, complete the [Pre-Search methodology](#appendix-pre-search-checklist) at the end of this document. This structured process uses AI to explore vector database options, embedding strategies, and RAG architecture decisions. Your Pre-Search output becomes part of your final submission.

This week emphasizes RAG architecture selection and implementation. Pre-Search helps you choose the right vector database and retrieval strategy for your use case.

## Background

Enterprise systems running on COBOL, Fortran, and other legacy languages power critical infrastructure: banking transactions, insurance claims, government services, and scientific computing. These codebases contain decades of business logic, but few engineers understand them.

This project requires you to build a RAG-powered system that makes large legacy codebases queryable and understandable. You will work with real open source enterprise projects, implementing retrieval pipelines that help developers navigate unfamiliar code through natural language.

The focus is on RAG architecture—vector databases, embedding strategies, chunking approaches, and retrieval pipelines that actually work on complex codebases.

**Gate:** Behavioral and technical interviews required for Austin admission.

## Project Overview

One-week sprint with three deadlines:

| Checkpoint | Deadline | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| MVP | Tuesday (24 hours) | Basic RAG pipeline working |
| Final (G4) | Wednesday (3 days) | Polish, documentation, deployment |
| Final (GFA) | Sunday (5 days) | Polish, documentation, deployment |

## MVP Requirements (24 Hours)

**Hard gate.** All items required to pass:

- [ ] Ingest at least one legacy codebase (COBOL, Fortran, or similar)
- [ ] Chunk code files with syntax-aware splitting
- [ ] Generate embeddings for all chunks
- [ ] Store embeddings in a vector database
- [ ] Implement semantic search across the codebase
- [ ] Natural language query interface (CLI or web)
- [ ] Return relevant code snippets with file/line references
- [ ] Basic answer generation using retrieved context
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible

*A simple RAG pipeline with accurate retrieval beats a complex system with irrelevant results.*

## Target Codebases

Choose ONE primary codebase from this list (or propose an alternative of similar scope):

| Project | Language | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GnuCOBOL | COBOL | Open source COBOL compiler |
| GNU Fortran (gfortran) | Fortran | Fortran compiler in GCC |
| LAPACK | Fortran | Linear algebra library |
| BLAS | Fortran | Basic linear algebra subprograms |
| OpenCOBOL Contrib | COBOL | Sample COBOL programs and utilities |
| Custom proposal | Any legacy | Get approval before starting |

Minimum codebase size: 10,000+ lines of code across 50+ files.

## Core RAG Infrastructure

### Ingestion Pipeline

| Component | Requirements |
|---|---|
| File Discovery | Recursively scan codebase, filter by file extension |
| Preprocessing | Handle encoding issues, normalize whitespace, extract comments |
| Chunking | Syntax-aware splitting (functions, paragraphs, sections) |
| Metadata Extraction | File path, line numbers, function names, dependencies |
| Embedding Generation | Generate vectors for each chunk with chosen model |
| Storage | Insert into vector database with metadata |

### Retrieval Pipeline

| Component | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Query Processing | Parse natural language, extract intent and entities |
| Embedding | Convert query to vector using same model as ingestion |
| Similarity Search | Find top-k most similar chunks |
| Re-ranking | Optional: reorder results by relevance score |
| Context Assembly | Combine retrieved chunks with surrounding context |
| Answer Generation | LLM generates response using retrieved context |

### Chunking Strategies

Legacy code requires specialized chunking. Document your approach:

| Strategy | Use Case |
|---|---|
| Function-level | Each function/subroutine as a chunk |
| Paragraph-level (COBOL) | COBOL PARAGRAPH as natural boundary |
| Fixed-size + overlap | Fallback for unstructured sections |
| Semantic splitting | Use LLM to identify logical boundaries |
| Hierarchical | Multiple granularities (file → section → function) |

## Testing Scenarios

We will test with queries like:

1. "Where is the main entry point of this program?"
2. "What functions modify the CUSTOMER-RECORD?"
3. "Explain what the CALCULATE-INTEREST paragraph does"
4. "Find all file I/O operations"
5. "What are the dependencies of MODULE-X?"
6. "Show me error handling patterns in this codebase"

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Query latency | <3 seconds end-to-end |
| Retrieval precision | >70% relevant chunks in top-5 |
| Codebase coverage | 100% of files indexed |
| Ingestion throughput | 10,000+ LOC in <5 minutes |
| Answer accuracy | Correct file/line references |

## Required Features

### Query Interface

Build a usable interface for querying the codebase:

- Natural language input for questions about the code
- Display retrieved code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Show file paths and line numbers for each result
- Confidence/relevance scores for retrieved chunks

| Documentation Gen | Generate documentation for undocumented code |
| Translation Hints | Suggest modern language equivalents |
| Bug Pattern Search | Find potential issues based on known patterns |
| Business Logic Extract | Identify and explain business rules in code |

## Vector Database Selection

|---|---|---|---|
| Pinecone | Managed cloud | Production scale | Free tier available, easy setup |
| Weaviate | Self-host or cloud | Hybrid search | GraphQL API, modules |
| Qdrant | Self-host or cloud | Filtering | Rust-based, fast |
| ChromaDB | Embedded/self-host | Prototyping | Simple API, local dev |
| pgvector | PostgreSQL extension | Existing Postgres | Familiar SQL interface |
| Milvus | Self-host or Zilliz | Large scale | GPU acceleration |

## Embedding Models

Choose an embedding model appropriate for code:

| Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Good balance of cost/quality |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | Higher quality, higher cost |
| Voyage Code 2 | 1536 | Optimized for code |
| Cohere embed-english-v3 | 1024 | Good for English text |
| sentence-transformers (local) | varies | Free, runs locally |

## AI Cost Analysis (Required)

Understanding AI costs is critical for production applications. Submit a cost analysis covering:

### Development & Testing Costs

Track and report your actual spend during development:

- Embedding API costs (total tokens embedded)
- LLM API costs for answer generation
- Vector database hosting/usage costs
- Total development spend breakdown

### Production Cost Projections

Estimate monthly costs at different user scales:

| 100 Users | 1,000 Users | 10,000 Users | 100,000 Users |
|---|---|---|---|
| $___/month | $___/month | $___/month | $___/month |

Include assumptions: queries per user per day, average tokens per query, embedding costs for new code additions, vector DB storage costs at scale.

## RAG Architecture Documentation (Required)

## Build Strategy

### Priority Order

1. Codebase selection — Pick and download your target repository
2. Basic ingestion — Read files, simple chunking, generate embeddings
3. Vector storage — Insert chunks, verify retrieval works
4. Query interface — Accept questions, return raw results
5. Answer generation — Add LLM to synthesize responses
6. Chunking refinement — Improve syntax-aware splitting
7. Advanced features — Implement 4+ code understanding features
8. Evaluation — Measure precision, document failure modes

### Critical Guidance

- Get basic retrieval working before optimizing chunking
- Test with real questions a developer would ask
- Measure retrieval quality before adding complexity
- Document failure cases—they inform architecture decisions
- Keep embedding dimensions consistent across ingestion and query
